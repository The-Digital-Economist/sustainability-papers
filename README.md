# Sustainability Papers | The Digital Economist

This collection focuses on what it takes to move from extractive systems to regenerative ones. The papers look at how capital, business models, and governance can be restructured to serve long-term ecological and social well-being—not just short-term returns.

## Papers & Publications

1. [Capital for the Common Good](./capital-for-the-common-good.pdf)  
   How to rewire capital markets to serve people and the planet.  
   This initiative lays out how financial systems can be redesigned to prioritize public value. It explores tools like impact investing, true-cost accounting, and mission-driven governance to shift flows of capital toward ecological restoration and social equity.

2. [Capitalism Is Sustainability’s Superhero](./capitalism-is%20sustainabilitys-superhero.pdf)  
   Why the system that caused the problem might be key to solving it.  
   This opinion piece argues that capitalism—if restructured—can become a driver of sustainability. It makes the case for using market forces to scale solutions like circular supply chains, clean energy, and inclusive innovation, instead of treating business as the enemy.

3. [From Exploitation to Regeneration](./from-exploitation-to-regeneration.pdf)  
   A roadmap for leaving extractive models behind.  
   This paper outlines the principles of regenerative economics—shifting from linear “take-make-waste” systems to ones that restore ecosystems and communities. It includes case studies across industries, showing how businesses and governments can embed stewardship into core operations.
